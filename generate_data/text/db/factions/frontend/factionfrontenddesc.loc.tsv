frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_main_gao_gan_faction_leader	Born to a family of prestige and fame, the resolute Gao Gan was granted training befitting a youth of his status. With his mind and blade honed, he is committed to the noble ideals of the gentry. Now, to support his esteemed uncle, Yuan Shao, Gao Gan dutifully raises troops to make a stand against the rebels and villains that dare to threaten the stability of the Han. In one hand, he holds aloft a shield, to repel the vile mountain bandits who attempt to encroach on Hebei. In the other, a blade is readied, to strike at the heart of the den of criminals to the west, and restore order and duty to a beleaguered land. With a spirit like an insurmountable bastion, Gao Gan makes his stand.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_main_song_jian_faction_leader	From the furthest western stretches of Liangzhou, Song Jian has been in open rebellion against the Han for years. One of the last remaining leaders of the original Liang Rebellion, he has remained steadfast and stubbornly independent, even isolating himself from his fellow rebels. All calls to submit or surrender fall on deaf ears, as he expands his domain to dominate the very sources of the great Yellow River. As he strives to dominate the western trade routes and the river sources, Song Jian is slowly amassing insurmountable wealth and power. With rivers of gold and silk running through his fingertips, and armies of loyal Qiang warriors at his side, it will be difficult indeed for any Han loyalist to dislodge the so-called Lord of the Sources...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_main_han_sui_faction_leader	The Liang Rebellion may have burned out to an ember, but Han Sui's ambitious heart burns as brightly as ever. He may have "surrendered" to the Han court, but this was always meant to be a temporary reprieve, or at worst, a set back. For now, the wily snake licks his wounds, and waits. For now, Ma Teng is a useful friend to have, but if he is to get in the way of Han Sui's grand plans, he will soon be discarded. The local lords of the western regions and weak and divided, and Han Sui bides his time until the inevitable day comes when the sparks of rebellion reignite. With the Han court under the grasp of a tyrant, and the east divided into bickering warlords, that day may come sooner than Han Sui ever expected...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_main_wuhuan_faction_leader	A fierce leader of the Wuhuan peoples, the name of Qiuliju is feared across the northern steppes. His people once aided the Han as auxiliary cavalry, but angered over a lack of pay, they joined a rebellion lead by Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun against the Empire. After many devastating clashes with his nemesis Gongsun Zan and his famed White Riders, Qiulijiu's wrath was eventually pacified by the arrival of the princely Liu Yu. Being one of the scant few Han officials who had the respect of the Wuhuan tribes, Liu Yu was able to convince the enraged chieftains to turn their backs on the rebellion. Joining forces with Liu Yu, Qiuliju aided in the pacification of the region. However, his enmity for Gongsun Zan has not begun to quell, and his warriors hunger for greater things. With the Xianbei still broken and divided, the Wuhuan are in position to stake a claim for hegemony over the steppes. Right now, the soothing diplomacy and kindness of Liu Yu are the only things sparing the world Qiulijiu's rampage...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_main_xiongnu_faction_leader	As a prince of the proud Southern Xiongnu, Yufuluo has spent his entire life as a vassal of the Han Empire. Dutifully, he has served as a commander against the Yellow Turbans, the Wuhuan and other rebels and tribes. Sadly however, when the time came that he needed the aid of the Imperial Court, few favours were granted. He had found himself exiled from his own clan following a power struggle upon the death of his father, the Chanyu. Claiming the Chanyu title himself, yet ousted by his own people, his pleas to the Imperial Court fell on deaf ears. Now, with only a small band of loyal friends and clansmen, he wanders the land as the leader of a mercenary band for hire, doing whatever he can to muster the resources and influence to take his rightful place as the leader of the Xiongnu.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_main_sun_ce_faction_leader	Sun Jian has never shied away from opportunity - and despite his loyalties, the fall of the imperial court presents great opportunities. As a young man, Sun Jian rose from the obscurity of his mercantile upbringing, learning from the deeds of his father that fortune must be seized - never expected. Since then, he has always led at the head of the charge, earning the epithet 'The Vanguard General'. It is this determined spirit that drives the Tiger of Jiangdong forward; may his roar sweep all obstacles away!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_liu_yu_190	There are few both within and without the Empire who have not heard tales of the magnanimity and beneficence of Liu Yu. As a proud and loyal member of the Imperial clan, Liu Yu uses every resource and scrap of influence he can for charitable means. Steel is forged into plows and tools rather than swords and armour, and alms are given both to the commonfolk under his rule, and the foreigners living across his northern border. With kindness and clever rhetoric, a speech alone from his lips can prevent a war. However, it would be foolish to dismiss Liu Yu's benign compassion for weakness. Should warlords refuse to listen to reason or rebels seek to exploit his charity, they will find his blade just as tempered as any other.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_wang_kuang_190	Of all the warlords and heroes who swore to bring an end to Dong Zhuo's regime, Wang Kuang stood out for his aggression and drive. From Henei, he sought to cross the Yellow River and storm the tyrant's camps from the north, and from there be the first to enter the capital and receive rightful recognition for his deeds and loyalty. However, even his hasty mustering was too slow to prevent the despotic regent from setting the ancient city of Luoyang ablaze. All that awaited for him at Heyang Ford was a mighty army of hardened Xiliang warriors, and despite fightly bravely, Wang Kuang found himself routed. With his bridgehead over the river lost and his armies scattered, the courageous warlord limped back to Henei to lick his wounds. There, he cursed his coalition "allies" for their ineptitude and unwillingness to advance, blaming them entirely for his defeat. Now, with rage and a hint of paranoia bubbling within him, Wang Kuang seeks to rebuild his forces. This time, he will trust only his own strength and capabilities, even if it means eschewing diplomacy and striking out at his former friends...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zhang_yang_190	The rugged mountains of Bingzhou have nurtured many brave warriors and hardy souls, and it currently falls under the man named Zhang Yang to shepherd them. Following the footsteps of the late and betrayed Ding Yuan, Zhang Yang finds himself in nominal command of a province divided. Bandits once thought quelled and pacified have re-emerged from their mountain hideouts, more ferocious than ever. Although the prize of reclaiming the Emperor and restoring Imperial authority is tantalisingly close, Zhang Yang must surely look to firmly establish his own rather unstable position first. His fellow coalition partners have become warlords in their own right, and surely have their own ambitions they hide behind their platitudes and smiles. Zhang Yang must not allow the pages of history to forget his name, and must strike out swiftly and with purpose, to prove his worth.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_yang_feng_190	In the aftermath of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, disorder still remained in more remote and rural corners of the Empire. Refugees, former rebels, mutinous soldiers and bandits wander the land, often tarred with the same brush. Among them, a handful rise to notoriety, their names hushed in whispers around campfires and garrisons, their reputation feared by merchant caravans and local gentry. Yang Feng is one of these men. He has raised a band of miscreants from the White Wave Valley, bringing a myriad and diverse crew together under his leadership. Both a bandit and mercenary at heart, Yang Feng smells the whiff of opportunity on the air. His allegiances are as flexible as his morals, as he leads his White Wave Bandits out of the Hedong valleys. No cause is beyond reproach, provided the rewards and pay are fitting!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_gongsun_du_190	Gongsun Du's youth was spent in absolute poverty, in unimaginably harsh conditions on the northern frontier. With nothing to speak of to his name, with no famous or wealthy relative to support him, everything he has ever gained or accomplished, he has earned through hard and often ruthless grit. Now, with the land in turmoil, opportunity finally arises for this self-taught warlord. The Han's control over the eastern fringes and southeastern peninsula is slipping away to local clans, and only a strong and stone-hearted warrior with knowledge of the area  can hope to tame it. Recommended by one of the generals of Dong Zhuo himself, Gongsun Du finally obtains a right to raise an army. Beyond the Liao river comes a chance of independence from the meek and incompetent bureaucrats of the Han, an opportunity to carve out a world where the strong survive and thrive. With an unrelenting iron fist, he seeks to smash those who dare stand in the way of his ambitious march.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_liu_dai_190	With the blood of royalty flowing through him, Liu Dai was amongst the first to answer the call of arms against the tyrant. Using his family name and influence, he claims rightful mastery over the Yan Province. Having absorbed the armies of his deceased rival Qiao Mao, and with the forces of Bao Xin sworn to him, Liu Dai continues to gather allies and noteworthy talents in his quest to rescue the Imperial throne from the despot. However, his campaign has had to halt and his warriors forced to return home, as the Yan region has exploded into rebellion and carnage. With resurgent and treasonous Yellow Turbans and craven brigands alike threatening his position, Liu Dai has little choice but to turn his regal blade on these motley curs first, before he can test the mettle of the Han's true enemy.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_ying_shao_190	With calligraphy pen in hand, Ying Shao dutifully scribes the happenings of the world about him, even as it enters such a dark age. Knowing full well the benefit of learning from the classics of the past, he hopes his own recordings will be able to teach and lecture future generations, passing down his own acquired knowledge for generations. With the carnage engulfing the world ever increasing, however, the historian and writer finds himself as a warlord in his own right, at the forefront of the spreading miasma of chaos. Will Ying Shao rise up to become a leader figure in the narrative of this uncertain era, or is he doomed to be left as a minor footnote in the margins of history?	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_chen_gui_190	Subtlety. Deception. Trickery. Misdirection. With these methods combined, the canny Chen clan flourishes in the shadows. With agents, spies, diplomats and scouts, Chen Gui has eyes and ears far and wide, maintaining a humble disposition whilst giving subtle nudges to the ebb and flow of the political world. With careful whispers and suggestions made to the right listeners, great men can be manipulated without even realising that their ideas are not their own. For now, the Chen family keep a patient stance and play the long game, silently but carefully observing the spreading maladies of the land, and waiting opportunities to further their own ends...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_ze_rong_190	A budding new religion is slowly spreading across the Han Empire from the west, and one of its earliest preachers is Ze Rong. Many devout followers, worshippers of the Great Buddha, have followed Ze Rong en masse. He now shelters as a commander under Tao Qian, who has granted him and his flock a safe haven to practice their worship. Being the leader of a nascent new religious order, however, is not an easy task, and requires influence, supplies, and funding. A lot of funding. To this end, Ze Rong seeks to spread the teachings of the Great Buddha far across the south and the east. If he happens to get incredibly wealthy and powerful along the way, it's all in the name of increasing the reach of his religious cause! That, and ensuring he can live a life of comfort and luxury...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zhang_chao_190	Being able to navigate through the intricate web of alliances between the gentry and noble clans is an important skill for a scholarly gentleman. Zhang Chao accomplishes this with aplomb, weaving friendships like a poet composes rhapsodies. Although stationed further east than any of his fellow coalition partners, he is no less committed to hunting the despotic Dong Zhuo and bringing a swift end to his reign of tyranny. To do so, Zhang Chao must make a firm  moral stance, and if need be, move to secure the Central Plains himself to wrest them away from rebels and traitors. By bringing control back in the hands of respectable, upstanding scholars from excelling clans, Zhang Chao seeks to restore the world to an era of harmony and tranquility.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_chen_wen_190	The proud governor of the Yangzhou region, Chen Wen announces a call to arms of all the brave and stalwart warriors of his province, so that their homes may be protected from threats external and internal. His skill at mustering troops is matched only by his talent in forging diplomatic allegiances. Despite not being an official member of the great coalition to oppose the tyrant, he has supported several of the warlords by providing troops, supplies and officers. With the south of his sphere of influence, across the great river, divided into petty lords, bandits, Shanyue chieftains, rebels and minions of Dong Zhuo, Chen Wen must work tirelessly to reunify Yangzhou under his leadership. The closed fist and the open hand are options both available to him, and indeed, if he is to safeguard his future, both his blade and diplomacy must be wielded in concert.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_bian_rang_190	A prolific writer, poet and historian, Bian Rang has served the Imperial court faithfully for many years. His vast volume of works have won him the admiration and respect of countless peers, including fellow renowned gentlemen such as Tao Qian. Following the commands of the late He Jin, Bian Rang accepted his current position as a regional governor without question. He has managed his lands ably and capably since arriving, and has used the opportunity to ever expand his portfolio of rhapsodies and poetry. However, Bian Rang is a man known very well for his almost blunt honesty and outspoken criticism of wrongdoers, criminals and the unfaithful. For that reason, it is little reason that he has refused to sworn loyalty to the despot that now holds his Imperial Majesty as a hostage in the distant western capital. The vile Dong Zhuo is not the only man who was earned the ire of Bian Rang, however. His keen gaze has turned to his neighbouring administrators and governors, too, carefully observing each of them for signs of warmongers, tyranny or abuse of their ambitions. Should any of them earn his emnity, Bian Rang will not be subtle with his criticisms, and will put his own life at risk if it means scolding them for evil deeds!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_lu_kang_190	A veteran administrator and loyalist to the Han court, Lu Kang boasts decades of experience, and has seen it all across a long career. Hailing from one of the most prominent gentry families of the south, his clan have long enjoyed the bounties of the Han, and have repaid this with unimpeachable duty. Lu Kang has weathered bandits, rebellions, famines and natural disasters alike, and his governance has not only survived it all, but thrived. Now, the wizened lord of Lujiang looks to secure his future. He has been blessed with a large family of talented souls, ensuring that the great Lu clan will surely prosper for many more decades to come.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zhang_lu_190	The Celestial Master Zhang Lu justly rules his people both as a religious leader and governor. His teachings preach equity, charity and fairness, which extends to his ever prosperous administration. As Zhang Lu builds roads and shares the wealth of his state to all its denizens, the Han court dismisses him as a cult leader and rebel. His unique brand of Daoist teachings are considered unorthodox and dangerous by more traditional scholars, and there are voices in the Imperial court that plea for his "rebellion" to be put down. From his well protected position in Hanzhong, Zhang Lu is well poised to spread his beliefs across the west, especially if he can escape the shackles of vassalage and free himself from the bonds imposed by Liu Yan. The people have suffered greatly under the decadent rule of the Han, and the time is now for Zhang Lu to show them a new way, a new path, towards prosperity...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_jia_long_190	For countless centuries, Bashu has been a veritable cradle of resources, farmland and wealth, nestled safely between the mountains and rivers. This hallowed land of plenty has been envied by many, and also fiercely protected by the local gentry and clans. Jia Long stands proudly as a current leader of the local loyalists of Bashu, and grimly peers out at the greedy cretins seeking to exploit his beloved home for their own means. Yellow Turbans, Taolist cultists, barbaric jungle tribes, even an upstart young pirate - Jia Long recognizes these ravenous criminals for what they are. An even bigger affront to the stalwart Jia Long is the recently arrived "Governor" Liu Yan, who is in his eyes a two-faced villain who is slowly displacing the local elites with his own eastern cronies. Against such insurmountable threats, Jia Long bravely displays his defiance. He will not rest until he reunites his beloved home, and makes Bashu great once again!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_liu_yao_190	Being distantly related to the Imperial clan, Liu Yao has thus far lead a privileged and charmed life. A scholarly, kind and honourable man, he became famous as a youth for personally rescuing a kinsman who had been kidnapped by brigands and rogues. This act helped accelerate his political career and standing, allowing him to rapidly rise through the bureaucracy. Now, he has been appointed his first major political position - one that will take him far from the capital, which may be a blessing in disguise given recent events in Luoyang. His post in distant Danyang finds him surrounded by squabbling local officials, warlords taking advantage of weakening Imperial authority, bandits and Shanyue rebels. Although not a man with a love for war, Liu Yao must find a way to secure his position, lest he be swept aside by the tides. With clever use of diplomacy and the blade alike, an opportunity awaits him, the chance to unleash the full potential of the fertile but wild Jiangdong region. A prosperous future lies in store, for those swift and bold enough to take decisive action...	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_wang_lang_190	One of the foremost men of learning of his era, Wang Lang was considered a prodigy of poetry and history from a very early age, with him especially noted for being a master of the Classics. He boasts a personal friendship with many other famous scholars, such as the likes of Tao Qian, Kong Rong and Hua Xin. Wang Lang fosters this academic background into his administration, promoting the construction of schools and providing tutors for the poor and needy. He uses his rhetoric and quick tongue to charm the local magnates, and conversely fiercely debates matters of law and legislature to those opposed to his policies. However, Wang Lang has now found himself in a world where rectitude and erudition cannot ensure either the stability of his government, nor his own survival. This notable scholar must learn new lessons, and fast, or a painful and miserable end to his governance sadly awaits.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zhu_hao_190	Being the son of the famed general Zhu Jun, even Zhu Hao's childhood was lived with military efficiency and strictness. The first books he learned to read were old army manuals, and he was soon directing his household servants around as if they were soldiers. Now, he finds himself promoted to the position of a local governor, down in the Jiangdong region where his father once earned his own fame. Zhu Hao has heavy expectations weighing down on him, and he is eager to both prove his capabilities and break out from the shadow of his famous father. Personally leading a handpicked militia of veterans, personal friends and recruited local warriors, Zhu Hao has made it his mission to decapitate the corrupt magnates who have used their wealth and fame to abuse the people for far too long. He sees potential enemies everywhere, but may have to learn to step out of the shoes of soldiery  and venture into the world of diplomacy and politics as well, lest he anger one lord too many...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_hua_xin_190	Renowned as a scholar, a bureaucrat and as a civil official, Hua Xin has always believed that positions of authority should be given to those with the right talents and correct abilities, rather than through birth-right or bribery. Fearing that his ideals would endanger him with Dong Zhuo's tyrannical rise, he was able to persuade the despot to allow him to govern some far off southern territory instead, and used this chance to flee from the capital. Along the way he briefly encountered the army of Yuan Shu, and advised him to take an immediate and aggressive stance against the usurper Dong. With the esteemed Yuan hesitant to commit, Hua Xin continued on his journey south. Now, still considered a loyal official of the Han, he has begun setting up his own local government and administration.  He begins promoting only men of merit and capability, and making political reforms in the regional bureaucracy. Those closest to him will know how privately critical Hua Xin is of the Han court, and how he desires more drastic and sweeping changes to the entire system of governance. For now, at least, all he can do is play his role as a minor and loyal official, far from the capital, at least until an opportunity for reformation presents itself.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zhuge_xuan_190	A dutiful and proud man, Zhuge Xuan is more passionate than most in his duties as administrator of Yuzhang. As well as striving hard to safeguard his territory from bandits, rebels and other threats, Zhuge Xuan believes he has a far more important mission that he must dutifully adhere to. The children of his late relative, Zhuge Gui, have been placed under his care, and it is these youths the represent the future of the entire Zhuge clan. Yuzhang is a land distant from the Central Plains and perhaps safe from the mayhem that has caused the north to shatter, but it is no tranquil island amidst a stormy sea. On the contrary, the Jiangdong region is home to countless perils, and as central authority has broken down, the lines between who governs what have blurred. Shanyue and brigands rise in rebellion, and local lords begin arming themselves and seeing to their own ambitions. Standing firm amidst all of this, Zhuge Xuan is akin to a beacon shining a light to the future. Even if it costs him his life, he will ensure that the Zhuge clan's next generations are positioned to make their mark on the world.	false

Gan Ning leads his brave band of vigilantes to both shores of the river, seeking out corrupt officials and their illgotten gains. Derided as a pirate by many, Gan Ning truly seeks one thing - freedom. Even with a scholar's blood in his veins, he cannot accept a life of mediocrity and the mundane. If no one will recognize his talents, he will find a way for his name to be known - with pillaging, plundering and piracy! For those who seek adventure on the Great River and the freedom of the wind on their backs, seek out Gan Ning. For those lords who instead mistreat the talented and promote the wicked, learn to fear the ringing of the bells!	false

Huang Zu is adept at both naval combat and more unconventional forms of warfare, and his talents at ambuscades and unorthodox tactics have proven themselves against rebels and bandits. From his strategic base at Jiangxia, he in position to protect both banks of the river from all manner of rabble, and if can master the waters, the tides of destiny will surely shift in favour of the Huang family.	false

To that end, the Cai clan have cast in their lots with Liu Biao through political marriages, and have been tied to many other local Jing families through weddings as well. Cai Mao is content to use Liu Biao as both a tool and a shield whilst his own family's influence slowly spreads out. Whilst Jingzhou may be a prize sought after by many a hungry beast, the sheer prolificacy of the Cai clan ensures them a bright future, even if the political game board is flipped, and new masters must be bowed to...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_kong_zhou_190	Famed under the Heavens for his mastery of philosophical debate and soothing sophistry, Kong Zhou understands well the importance of harmony and balance in all aspects of life. Fearing the dangers of allowing Dong Zhuo's cruel regime to bring instability to the realm, he eagerly answers the call of arms to depose the despot. From his position in Yuzhou, however, the court and imprisoned Emperor seem further and further away - especially after the old capital is set alight and the tyrant retreats far to the west. Kong Zhou also finds himself somewhat isolated from his coalition allies - but he is certain that with careful diplomacy and wise words, he can help direct his fellow patriots from afar. Yuzhou, however, is an unstable land surrounded by greedy foes. Should these rebels and caitiffs all about fail to listen to logic and reason, Kong Zhou realises a far firmer hand will be required to maintain the balance.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_han_fu_190	Soldiers cannot fight without equipment, and armies cannot march when hungry. Generals may win battles, but wars are fought with logistics. As the man responsible for supplying much of the northern warlords, Han Fu is keenly aware of his own importance. Even as the rest of the coalition dithers and falters before the tyrant, Han Fu slowly and calmly stockpiles his provisions. He knows keenly that the northern lords will be reliant on food grown on his lands for sustenance, and their own ambitions are all for naught if they cannot even feed their men. Therefore, Han Fu finds himself in an enviable position, one that can puppet the lords and generals with sacks of grain. Should he act with a keen mind and a bold strength of will, he has a prime opportunity to dominate the north through diplomacy and logistics alone, all the while his foes only get hungrier. He must be wary, however, not to overplay his hand too soon - starving wolves can act erratically, after all, and cannot be tamed.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_ma_ai_190	The matters of the Central Plains, the warlords, the rebellions and infighting, mean little to the likes of Ma Ai, a man sent to watch over the very gates to the Han's most extreme western borders. The concerns of his tenure thus far have been primarily securing the crucial trade routes west, and bartering and negotiating with foreign peoples across the frontier. However, as remote and distant his post may be, Ma Ai is not unaware of the dismal carnage that has erupted elsewhere in the Empire. With rebellions across Liangzhou, the once flowing rivers of gold and silk have practically dried up. Elsewhere, with the capital burning and the entire court uprooting, commerce has begun to collapse, especially as the Central Plains explode into petty clashing and skirmishes between rival clans. Therefore, perhaps in this trying times, even a practically forgotten border guard like Ma Ai must make a mark on the world? After all, what use is doggedly protecting a barren frontier when the heart of the Empire is being torn out? Although stalwartly looking out west as a watchman, Ma Ai keeps a single eye trained eastwards, in case his services and soldiers are required elsewhere...	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_huang_clan_190	With the entire breadth of the land suffering upheaval, it often turns to local landowners to protect themselves, when the government cannot. Powerful and wealthy gentry clans gather hundreds or thousands of families under their protection, arming private soldiers to safeguard estates and farmland from banditry and barbarians. Some of the more powerful gentry become akin to warlords in their own right, expanding their influence and power over other regional clans and even local officials. The Huang family in Liangzhou has become one of these - with the Han court paralyzed to help, the local magnates must seek to look after each other, stockpiling whatever arms and resources they can to brace against a rebellious storm.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_handan_shang_190	The leaders of the Liang Rebels may have allegedly submitted to the court, but their armies remain, as do many of their Qiang allies. To the Han officials sent west to wrest control back of the troubled frontier province, their task is steep and unenviable. Handan Shang, a scholarly man of good stock, is one of the leading officials newly assigned to a post in this rebellious land. For now, he has little choice but to align himself with other court officers sent to Liangzhou, putting aside any personal grievances to become a leading figure amongst them. He must work swiftly to establish a foothold of control over the territory he has been assigned to govern, knowing full well that the court is far too preoccupied with other matters to send more help. Although some of the regional lords may be amiable to diplomacy or treaties, Handan Shang knows that trusting the likes of Han Sui or Song Jian is a foolish errand, and more secure means of deterrence will be required to quell their petty ambitions.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_di_tribes_190	The Di tribes live a pastoral and idyllic life, farming and logging in quiet valleys nestled by imposing peaks.  Although occasionally drafted into Han armies to put down local rebellions or hired as mercenary warriors, they rarely find themselves embroiled with affairs outside of their home in the western mountains. In recent years, however, the rebellions of the Qiang tribe have inspired scores of young Di fighters to join the leaders of the Liangzhou uprising. Fearing that before long, his people will draw the ire of some greedy and ambitious warlord or another, chieftain Dou Mao gathers his allied clans and prepares weapons and armour. Should some foolhardy invader stumble into his lands, Dou Mao will bring the very wrath of the mountains themselves down to smite them!	false

To that end, he cares nothing for pomp and ceremony, nothing for traditions and etiquette. His own overlord and adopted father, Ding Yuan, was murdered in exchange for a bribe, a horse and a title. Now, atop the unstoppable and unmatchable Red Hare, Lü Bu charges into the fray in the name of a new adopted father - the treacherous Dong Zhuo. Together, they are a nightmare for the stability of the world and its established orders. Unmatched on the battlefield as he may be, however, Lü Bu's desires and craves never quell, no matter how much wine parches his throat, fine food fills his belly, or blood stains his halberd. The very balance of the land quivers before his prowess, but how long can he and the despotic Dong Zhuo share a fate?	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_xianbei_kuitou_190	With the sudden death of the great Tanshihuai, the Xianbei confederation splintered and shattered as quickly as it was founded. With his sons too dying in swift succession, the legacy of Tanshihuai falls to his young grandsons. Kuitou struggles to wrest control of the bickering Xianbei clans, with many splitting off and scattering across the steppes, refusing to recognise the command of such a young and untested warrior. Of those left, he has to vie with his ambitious and dynamic younger brothers for power, as well as other voices of dissent in what remains of the alliance of clans. There are even those who declare that his youthful cousin Qianman is the rightful successor to Tanshihuai's legacy. If Kuitou is to attempt to make his own mark in the world, never mind surpass his famed grandfather, he must secure his own succession and position as leader of all the Xianbei, by proving himself as a man above all others.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_xianbei_tuoba_190	The Tuoba clan of the Xianbei are one tribe of many who split off to find their own path following the sudden demise of Tanshihuai, and the collapse of his confederation. Their patriarch, Tuoba Jiefan, leads his allies across the steppes, in search of a new home for his people. The future of his clan are all that are on the mind of this ambitious headsman, even as his own sons bicker over the direction their wandering should take. The independence of the Tuoba matter above all else, and they will not bow to a chieftain, king or Emperor alike, not when their fates are in their own hands, and the very horizon is theirs to take!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_faction_jiuzhen_190	During an poorly planned and ill-advised expedition to reclaim the far south region of Rinan for the Han, a disaster struck as the campaigning army got lost in the thick, unforgiving jungles. Men perished due to ambushes and raids by local tribes, whilst others got lost in the mists and trees, never to be found again. Many more succumbed to hunger or dehydration once the supply chains reached breaking point. Countless others were inflicted by exotic diseases and ailments. Eventually, only one man returned from this illfortuned campaign - a low ranking officer named Qu Pan. Although riddled with strange illnesses himself, and having quite possibly gone mad, he refused the aid of the physicians. Instead, he declared that during his adventures, he found the greatest military mind the world had ever seen, who was in seclusion and isolation deep in the southern jungles. After seven visits to this sagacious strategist, each with increasingly ludacrous outcomes, Qu Pan was eventually able to win his favour. Now, he has brought this genius hermit, Commander Lu, back to Jiuzhen with him, and obeys his every word, believing that he possess the one true plan that will lead to a new dynasty. Together with a bizarre band of whoever will follow him ( mainly made up of alcoholics, maniacs and madmen), Qu Pan resumes his expedition, this time following the advice of the wise and cunning Commander Lu. \\n\\n Do not dare suggest that Commander Lu is just a rather noisy parrot permenantly perched on Qu Pan's shoulder. Commander Lu does not like that very much. Commander Lu thinks that such seditious talk should be punished. \\n\\n Commander Lu knows all and sees all.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_wu_jing_190	Wu Jing is the current head of the dynamic Wu clan of Wu county. His family are known for their fierce independent spirit as well as their wealth and influence over the Jiangdong region. Marriage and old deals have connected the Wu to many of the other local powers and families in the region. Following the news of the turmoil erupting first in the Imperial capital and then throughout the Central Plains, Wu Jing senses a chance. A man who has always put the needs of his clan and kin first, he realises that aggressive action is needed to safeguard his family and home. He sees his beloved Jiangdong region in the hands of unworthy bureaucrats, simpering sycophants, mountain bandits and rebels alike, and he comes the conclusion he has to take action himself. Taking up his sword, and calling in favours from other powerful local nobles such as the Xu and Zhu clans, Wu Jing prepares to make his stand. For, above everything else, family.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_wang_sheng_190	With humility and self deprecation bordering on meekness, Wang Sheng has lead a rather misfortunate life so far. As a young man, his attempt to marry a beautiful maiden of the Wu clan was thwarted when she instead fell for the brash and boisterous warrior son of a melon farmer instead. Since then, bad luck has hit Wang Sheng on every corner, with him being offered only middling promotions after years of hard work and service. He has always seen the more popular (and louder) politicians advance far quicker, using their connections and charms to win promotions. Wang Sheng has quietly carried out every duty required of him, which has at last won him in an administrative post. He finds himself in a distant backwater on the frontier, a land plagued by rebels and Shanyue bandits. Wang Sheng quickly realises he is a puppet in his own court, with the eccentric generals and officials of his administration holding the real power. Still, he keeps his head down - and realises that his calming hand and eye for detail may be required to prevent his bickering officers from clashing with each other. With enemies within and without, it is finally Wang Sheng's time to stand up. Even the meek and timid can only be pushed so far, after all, and sometimes the quiet ones are those to be truly feared.	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_tong_zhi_190	Until recently, the Tong clan was a fairly unknown gentry clan from the Luling region in the far south. A family with local prominence and influence, for sure, but not one with lasting fame, or prestige that extended much further than the borders of their ancestral home. Surely, this was just another clan destined to exist in obscurity, one of countless names that one would be lucky to find in a footnote of history. \\n However, the dynamic and ambitious (and some would say foolhardy) new head of the Tong clan refuses to accept this sordid destiny! Tong Zhi rejects this reality, and replaces it with his own. Hearing news of the collapse of central authority, and seeing the local region being torn asunder by rebels, talentless politicians and wannabe warlords, Tong Zhi asks himself - "Why? Why shouldn't I rule instead?" Immediately, he springs into action, declaring himself the new Governor of Luling! Certainly, he lacks any authority to do this, and may be lacking in fame, prestige, reputation, experience and knowledge, but he possesses audacity beyond most others, and ambition bordering on delusion! Fortune favours the bold, and in chaos, insolence thrives! Assembly a motley crew of clansmen, old friends, local toughs and random vagabonds, Tong Zhi will make his mark or die trying! With his impudent pluck and aspirations soaring, Tong Zhi refuses to go down in the annals as "literally who".	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_liu_xun_190	With the pressures of the age hemming him in from all directions, Liu Xun finds himself in a quandary. On one side are his duties to the Imperial court, and his official position as a ranked bureaucrat. On the other are many old friends and kin, rising up in arms against the tyrant, and forging out their own domains and factions. Of his old comrades, the likes of Yuan Shu and Cao Cao are particularly ambitious. A challenge crossroads lies before him. Should Liu Xun ignore the call to arms spreading throughout China and manage his territory like a loyal subject of the court, or should he instead follow the lead of his contemporaries and carve out his own independence? If this latter option is taken, a perhaps even more crucial decision has to be made - which of these old friends are to be made allies, and which are destined to be met as foes on the field of war? As time slips away, Liu Xun increasingly needs to weigh up his choices...	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_ironic_faction_yellow_turban_wu_huan_190	Whilst the Yellow Turban uprising devastated the Central Plains, causing wounds than run deep still to this day, the southern provinces of China were mostly spared from the fiercest of fighting. Aside from a few pockets of rebellion and zealotry, the lands south of the Yangtze instead became safe havens for those seeking to escape the battles and conflict. Wu Huan, therefore, finds himself in an unenviable position, with a thankless task. A true believer in the teachings and message of the late Zhang Jue, Wu Huan has spent years trying to foment uprisings in his home land deep in the south of Jiangdong. With no contact with or support from the other leaders of the Yellow Turbans, Wu Huan's task so far has proven nigh impossible. Finally however, after years of effort, a spark has been ignited in the far south. A nascent ember on the wind for now, with proper nurturing and care it could spread to an inferno. Potential enemies are everywhere, as the local lapdogs of the Han already scramble to snuff out Wu Huan's rebellion before it has even begun. He is a man with patience and fervour on his side and has not come this far and worked so tirelessly to be defeated so quickly. With his independent heart of a true, proud southerner beating strongly in his chest, Wu Huan will soar! 	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_fei_zhan_190	The untamed, wild south remains fiercely independent, even after centuries of nominal rule by the Han of the north. Whilst the coastlines and riverbanks may be settled and colonised by the northerners, the spirit of the Yue people remains alive, especially in the thick, foreboding forests and deep in the valleys amidst the stark hills and peaks. In the eyes of the Han, Fei Zhan is an obscure outlaw or hill bandit, whose name is on the lips of very few. To those who know him and care about him, however, he is a chieftain and leader. Having recently taking leadership of his clan, he seeks nothing more to be left alone, and for his homeland to be left unspoiled and unexploited. To do so, he will have to weave a difficult path. Diplomacy and ferocity will have to be balanced in order to ensure the survival of his followers, and mastery of both the blade and pen will have to be displayed if the warlords of the Han grant him the respect he surely deserves.	false

frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_you_tu_190	An unashamed and self-admitting brigand, You Tu controls his band of outlaws with a tight fist. With intimidation and threats of force, he has overawed other regional hill tribes and gangs into submitting to his own. Merchants and traders fear travelling through the hills and forests You Tu has carved out for his own dominion, and even villages and outposts nestled along the coast have not escaped from his raids. Now, You Tu seeks a far greater prize than merely looting some distant hamlets or mugging passing tradesmen. He senses that the great rule of the Han, centuries old, is weakening fast. Their southern garrisons are undermanned and poorly maintained, their leaders disillusioned and disunited. Seeing a chance for profits and power alike, You Tu leads his mob of bandits not to plunder, but to war and conquest!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_pan_lin_190	Rebellions cannot be made in haste. An unimaginable amount of planning, preparation and work have to be carried out before an uprising can truly begin. After all, without organization and groundwork, there is little difference between rebellion and an unruly mob. Pan Lin, a dynamic young leader of a southern tribe, knows this all too well, having studied failed rebellions against the Han and having learned from their mistakes. He is patient and cautious, but also decisive. Near his people's homeland are ineffective, weak, but wealthy lords and bureaucrats, who have grown fat and complacent. He marks these as easy targets to gain much needed provisions, equipment and resources for a much grander scale rebellion. Hearing news from the north that the capital of the Han is in flames and the warlords are clashing with each other, Pan Lin realises he may never get a better chance. He must strike hard and true, but be wary not to overextend too quickly, lest the lords of the north realise what is happening, settle their differences, and band against him!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zu_lang_190	Freedom must be earned, and independence must be won. Zu Lang has strived for years to carve out a piece of harmony for his people, granting them the liberty to enjoy their lifestyles and cultures away from Han rule. Now, with the northern courts in turmoil and the lords of the land drawing steel against each other, Zu Lang realises that it is time for him to truly rise up. The Shanyue of the south shall take up arms against their oppressors, and never again be subjects of some distant Emperor of the north! For the freedom and liberty of his people, Zu Lang shall fight until his final breath!	false
frontend_faction_leaders_localised_description_3k_main_political_party_zhao_wei_190	Previously an official working for the Han court, Zhao Wei was among the men who followed Liu Yan into the Yi province when he accepted the post of Governor. Skilled at both military and civil affairs, he is trusted and respected by Liu Yan, his nominal superior, even if the two men often do not get along. He has been sent to settle rebellions in Ba and Baxi, and has begun recruiting talented local men and scholars. Zhao Wei firmly believes that the literati and learned of the province are incredibly useful assets, and their loyalties must be won if Yi is to be secured. At the same time, whilst he shows sympathy to the local gentry, he is increasingly concerned about Liu Yan's "Dongzhou" clique of men and refugees from the east. The influence of the Dongzhou faction and clans such as the Wu and Pang are already disrupting the delicate balance of power in Yi province, in Zhao Wei's observations at least. Powerful noble families have already risen up against Liu Yan's new regime, and Zhao Wei is weighing up his options. As this quandary takes place, the question of the aging Liu Yan's succession is on everyone's minds, particularly in Zhao Wei's careful calculations. Perhaps, for now, it is best that he plays the role of a loyal subordinate to the Liu family, patiently waiting until a weaker or meeker man takes Liu Yan's stead. Or, perhaps he should consider his own aspirations, and take advantage of Liu Yan's unstable position to strike early? Until he can stabilise his own forces, Zhao Wei is unsure what to do, but whatever decision he makes could alter the fate of the entire region...	false
