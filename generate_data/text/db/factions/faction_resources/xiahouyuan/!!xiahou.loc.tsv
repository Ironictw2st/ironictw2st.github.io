effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiahou_yuan_resource_level_0	It is almost impressive just how inept your forces are. Drunken brawls break daily in each of your camps. Your scouts get lost, your raiding parties plunder your own supplies. Your captains and lieutenants bicker over petty grievances. Worst of all, you have done very little to stop this downward spiral. How can you hope to even survive like this?	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiahou_yuan_resource_level_1	You have thoroughly neglected in your military's logistics. Like hungry hounds, your men claw at whatever scraps they can. Your warriors grow lean and hungry, which leads only to desperation and mutiny.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiahou_yuan_resource_level_2	Your army is ready to march wherever you need to them to go, and are prepared to combat any adversary. Be careful, however, to secure a solid supply line, and ensure your troops remain well fed and well equipped.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiahou_yuan_resource_level_3	Thanks to your capable command, your army surges forth with high spirits and full bellies. Your camps are organised, and your officers are promoted on merit. With the trust you place in your subordinates, you can win battles before swords are even drawn.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiahou_yuan_resource_level_4	The harshest of terrains, the most unforgiving of climates and the fiercest of foes are not enough to slow the unconquerable march of your army. Your every order passes through your intricate command structure without question. Supplies reach your frontlines unimpeded regardless of weather or distance. Your warriors enjoy the sharpest of blades, the toughest of armours and the fittest of steeds. Under the heavens, none can compete with your command.	true
