effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_war_weariness_resource_level_0	Just by looking out over your lands is enough evidence to prove your worth as a leader. Your harvests are bountiful, your commoners safe and satisfied, your silos are fully stocked, and your guards are well rested. In a period of conflict, your territory is now famous as an island of tranquility.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_war_weariness_resource_level_1	Although no songs will yet hail you as being a champion of peace, you have much to show for your excellent governance. Farmers till their crops unmolested, and previously drained stockpiles begin to recover. The streets of your cities are orderly and your nobles content, but your strategists do advise you against a policy of complacency...	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_war_weariness_resource_level_2	Trouble is brewing in your domain. Greedy warlords akin to snarling beasts snap at your borders, whilst unsatisfied and hungry citizens flee your towns to eke out their own living. Conflict is, sadly, inevitable, despite your perhaps naive wishes for diplomatic solutions. The generals in your court now have louder voices than your civil officials, as dark clouds begin to gather overhead.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_war_weariness_resource_level_3	The cost of war comes at a high price for your dominion. Your overstretched army can barely replace its losses, as the numbers of injured, the exhausted and mutinous mount up. Supplies are increasingly needed for military efforts, leading to essential foodstuffs being seized from your own farmers. As people grow hungrier, they grow angrier, and out of desperation they start to take their frustrations out on your regime. Within your inner circle, some advisors beg you to consider suing for peace, whilst other commanders openly blame your poor leadership for not being able to bring a swift end to the conflict. If something is not done with haste, disaster looms.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_war_weariness_resource_level_4	Just by walking your streets can the cost of your decisions be clearly seen. Beggars crowd every corner, many of them former soldiers too maimed to even return to their former occupations. Once bustling markets and taverns now lie deserted as more and more flee your towns for what they hope is a better life elsewhere. Those who remain are often sick, hungry or exhausted, or have resorted to banditry just to fill their bellies. Reports of cannibalism are everywhere, as are reports of families selling their own children for a handful of grain. Your shattered army can do little to protect your people, never mind guard your borders. History is poised to remember you as a harbinger of disaster, if your ruinious deeds are even worth the ink to record them.	true
