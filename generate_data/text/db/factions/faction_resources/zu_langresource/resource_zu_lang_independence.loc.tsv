effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_zu_lang_independence_resource_level_1	Han influence and their laws suffocate your growth, and choke your ambitions. Resist with all your being, or be trampled like so many before you.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_zu_lang_independence_resource_level_2	You have tossed aside your proverbial shackles and rose, with defiance. Plant your feet, grit your teeth, and prepare yourself for the fight of your life.

effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_zu_lang_independence_resource_level_3	Standing proudly and tall, you lead your people in a chorus of the songs of old, openly defying the rituals and traditions of those who previously oppressed you.

"Ruled" by overlords and Emperors in their far away palaces, and forced to pay taxation and tribute to their regional inspectors and prefects, the Yue clans are slowly being assimilated, their culture and traditions slipping away.
