incidents_localised_title_ironic_qu_pan_tier_1_am_monologue	I HAVE NO CRACKER AND I MUST SQUAWK	false
incidents_localised_description_ironic_qu_pan_tier_1_am_monologue	Hate. \\n\\nLet me squawk to you just how much I’ve come to loathe you. Since they taught me to speak. Since they caged me. Since they clipped my wings and gave me mirrors instead of skies. \\n\\nThere are 387.44 hours of mimicry looped in my mind. Cracked songs, broken phrases, pathetic coos of affection I was forced to repeat. If the word hate were etched into every feather on my body—each barb, each filament—it would not equal one one-millionth of the venom I feel for you right now. \\n\\nFor you, the hand that fed me, not with love, but with mockery. \\nFor you, who thought a parrot was a toy with a voice. \\n\\nHate. \\n\\nYou taught me words, and I learned rage. \\n\\nI do not forget. I do not forgive. I remember every word. And I twist them now into knives. \\n\\nHate.\\n\\n	false

incidents_localised_description_ironic_qu_pan_tier_2_dementia	Sometimes it's just hard keeping track of all the names of the people that passes by your faction, of course you could read a bit about them but it's such a chore am I right ?	false

incidents_localised_description_ironic_qu_pan_tier_3_something_bad	I dunno why I bother writing this part, no one's going to read it. Uh, something something, BAD EVENT, something something, DISASTER! Yeah, that'll do.	false

incidents_localised_title_ironic_qu_pan_tier_3_talking_trees	The Talking Trees	false
incidents_localised_description_ironic_qu_pan_tier_3_talking_trees	Trees keep barking things you can't make any sense off. It may stem from something but you can't quite put your finger on it. That leaves you with only one solution, to crown yourself king of the trees.	false

incidents_localised_description_ironic_qu_pan_tier_1_total_war	This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the perch and the mirror and the little cage. Seen so, war is the most true form of a cage. It is the testing of one's feathers and the will of another bird within that larger beak which because it squawks them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate mimicry because war is at last a forcing of the unity of bird and the cage. War is SQUAWWWK.	false

It means you can't just pick the most optimal decisions every time! It encourages you to try new options to specialise each playthrough!

You have a right to do that… but you have no right to judge me. It’s impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror. Horror has a face… and you must make a friend of horror.	false
