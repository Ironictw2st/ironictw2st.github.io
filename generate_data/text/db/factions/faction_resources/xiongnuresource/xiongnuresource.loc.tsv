effect_bundles_localised_title_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_5	The Great Xiongnu Empire	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_0	Your ancestors weep at what has become of the Xiongnu. The lords of the Han openly mock your crumbling clan, and your own kith and kin have turned their backs on you. You can barely muster enough tribute to pay your own bodyguards. Calamity awaits such a fatuous chieftain as you.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_1	You struggle tooth and nail to prevent your very world from falling apart around you. With your treasury drying up, every day you see more and more depart your clan for more profitable pastures. Even those most loyal to you are expressing their doubts. All those remaining stare at you with greed, and hunger.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_2	To those lackies of the Han, growing fat behind their stone walls, you are little more than bandits and brigands from the northern wastes. They know nothing of your culture and people...but also underestimate your strength. They still call you a "barbarian." Show them that the glory days of the mighty Xiongnu still exist beyond the songs and campfire stories.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_3	The very heavens have started to quake under the countless hooves you command. Even the most ignorant of southern noble is beginning to realize their folly. Like the Xiongnu heroes of old, you will make the Han remember what real fear feels like. Redeem the shame of your ancestors, and claim your revenge.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_4	Once, your people were derided as raiders and pillagers, little more than common thugs and looters. Now, you sweep south as conquerors. Those of the Han with wisdom see the changing tides and side with you. Those foolish enough to resist will burn. The steppes alone cannot contain your ambition. All under the Heavens shall be yours.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_xiongnu_resource_level_5	From the endless steppes to the Central Plains to even further beyond, there are none who do not fear and respect you. Now, it is the Xiongnu who are dominant, whilst the people of the Han cower and prostate themselves before your kin. There are those stupid enough to resist, of course. To them, you shall show no mercy. Eternal glory awaits. 	true
