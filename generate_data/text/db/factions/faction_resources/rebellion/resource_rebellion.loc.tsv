effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_bandit_resource_level_6	The people muster under your banners, and your numbers multiply day by day.

effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_bandit_resource_level_7	Your forces gather in proper formation, with organised ranks and a real command structure.
