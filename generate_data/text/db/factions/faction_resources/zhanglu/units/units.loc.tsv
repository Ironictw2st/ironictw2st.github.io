unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_militia_mounted_sabre_earth	The lighter the armour, the faster the warrior, the quicker the strike, the sooner the kill.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_militia_ji_wood	These women are as adept at swinging their blades as pulling their bows; elite and versatile infantry.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_militia_spearmen_wood	These women have basic weapons, and determination in droves. But that's essentially all they have.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_horse_archers_water	These mounted archers excel at harassing enemy troops, but are unafraid of charging into the melee if needed.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_farmland_protectors_wood	Leaving behind petty crime to swell the ranks, these women are armed with long spears to defend against cavalry charges.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_farmland_hunters_water	Recently arrived, and poorly trained, these women are armed with a simple bow and the will to fight.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_farmland_warriors_metal	Poorly trained and armed with cheap axes, these women may not be formidable, but they are many!	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_ji_infantry_wood	Infantry armed with polearms to pierce the armour of heavy cavalry, but, without a shield, they are vunerable to enemy missiles	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_spear_guards_wood	These infantry protect the flanks; their shields guard against enemy missiles, while enemy cavalry skewer themselves on their spears. 	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_farmland_band_metal	Hardened by the bandit life, the furious charge of these axe-swinging women is deadly to enemy infantry.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_sabre_infantry_metal	Well-trained armoured infantry, carrying rattan shields and zhibeidao swords for close combat with enemy infantry.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_ji_infantry_wood	A people only truly die when their name is spoken for the last time. Until then, they live on.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_di_marauders_earth	Merciless tribal cavalry, crashing into enemies with a devastating charge and dispatching any survivors with swords.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_sabre_cavalry_earth	These cavalry troops are equipped with rattan shields to neutralise archers and zhibeidao swords to combat enemy cavalry units alike.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_vanguards_fire	Women chosen for the bravery needed to charge headlong into the enemy, polearms thrust to the fore.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_swordguards_metal	Few have the skills to master the ancient fighting style of the jian sword while parrying blows with a shield.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_militia_sabres_metal	Veteran rebel women armed with a sabre, shield and a swift, strong charge.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tao_penitents_wood	With little to no martial training, these miscreants are commited to serving out their sentences in order to redeem themselves.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_reclaimers_wood	These women gather equipment dropped or left behind in battle to help their sisters continue the fight.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_militia_mounted_lancer_fire	Personally selected by the Empress, these heavily-armoured women are the vanguard of the frontline.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_melee_cavalry_earth	Noble ladies who have spurned their loyalties to their former masters and now serve Zheng Jiang.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_horse_archers_water	The quarry of these mounted archers was once waterfowl, but is now considerably larger, which only makes for an easier target.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_zhenren_defenders_wood	When they had no home or purpose, Zheng Jiang provided. Now they will defend both.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_militia_archers_water	Fearless emissaries of Tai, whose powerful charge strikes down all who would oppose them.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_wudou_archers_water	Highly-trained women who excel when unleashing rapid volleys of arrows to slow and supress cavalry charges.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_archers_water	These archers’ long siyah horn bows increase the velocity of their arrows, while they fend off attackers with zhibeidao swords.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_di_horse_archers_water	The Di were infamous, feared for their lightning-fast attacks and ceaseless harassment of their foes.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_di_raiders_fire	Light, manoeuvrable cavalry can create chaos and confusion in the enemy ranks and, ultimately, victory.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_di_cataphracts_fire	Di, masters of cavalry, know exactly how, and where, to deploy their armoured horses for maximum devastation.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_vanguards_fire	Elite women hand-picked by the Empress for their versatility and excellence in archery	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_trebuchet_water	Hurling large, heavy projectiles to breach enemy defences from afar requires quite a feat of engineering.	false
unit_description_short_texts_text_ironic_multiple_bolt_crossbow_water	Be they man or monster, no one can withstand the thundering force of not one, but many, ten-foot bolts. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_militia_spearmen_wood	Even in the most irregular of armies, a core of spears is essential to maintain an effective fighting line. This is no different for the Tai than it is for the Han. They are lightly-equipped, armed only with spear, shield, and a fierce, but blind determination. Although they are a far cry from the elite spearmen of the empire, they fight no less fiercely for a lack of  experience.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_militia_mounted_sabre_earth	Whereas some cavalry bring a primal, instantly shattering force to the battlefield, other mounted warriors are suited to the slower burn, embroiling themselves in the melee and staying to continue inflicting casualties. \\n\\n These marauders carry dual axes into battle so, whilst they get less power on the charge, their destructive capability increases dramatically once they begin hacking away at foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_militia_ji_wood	The blade and bow have very different roles; the first is for close combat, while the second is to be used at long range to assault and harass targets from a safe distance. Masters of both, such as these women archers, are valuable because of their versatility. \\n\\n Each soldier of this elite unit has earned their unique composite bow by proving exceptional accuracy and strength in archery, and has had more than a year’s training to ensure they wield their Jian swords with expert and deadly precision.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_horse_archers_water	These cavalry troops may not have the finest of weapons, but the ability to fire arrows from horseback while keeping out of reach from the enemy makes them incredibly useful on the battlefield. Their horses are trained not to panic amid the din and chaos of battle, but instinctively retreat from encroaching enemies. \\n\\n Should the enemy manage to corner these troops, they wear partial iron armour and are armed with zhibeidao swords so that they can defend themselves until permitted to pull back.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_farmland_protectors_wood	Starving and garbed in rags, these outlaws have low morale, little training and no armour. Still they volunteer for battle, gathered by the rallying call that travelled word-of-mouth through the local dives and hangouts. \\n\\n  Spears are braced against the enemy cavalry that tower above as these women pray that numbers will overwhelm stronger forces.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_farmland_hunters_water	A call to arms, particularly against tyranny, is often answered by more than just the land’s heroes and warriors. The downtrodden need only to hear support for their plight to be galvanised into action, and these women have fashioned simple bows to join the cause. \\n\\n They enter battle in tattered tunics and lack the skill, courage and eyes of seasoned archers, but if enough arrows are launched, no matter how poorly aimed, the deluge is bound to find some targets.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_farmland_warriors_metal	Emboldened by the promise of food, these outlaws arm themselves with their axes and head for the frontlines. \\n\\n During battle, their low morale means they can be easily routed. However, they are cheap and numerous to raise and in large enough numbers can still be useful in charging and swamping the enemy’s flanks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_ji_infantry_wood	To guard against a cavalry charge use the horse’s momentum and weight against them; brace long polearms at an angle and await the charge so the horses pierce themselves on the waiting defences. \\n\\n A ji polearm has an angled blade attached to the top and a spear added to the tip, making it a versatile weapon for hooking and dismounting cavalry or slashing at riders. \\n\\n While these troops brace themselves against cavalry charges, their own hides are protected by iron armour.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_farmland_band_metal	Though the heavy fu axe was once used as a tool, it has been repurposed for the battlefield - now its chief purpose is to split foes' skulls. \\n\\n These women are confident because of their powerful charge; the warriors swing their axes in one hand while the other holds a shield to parry retaliatory blows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_spear_guards_wood	The most vulnerable parts of any army are its flanks; a surprise attack can easily panic the troops, causing a cascade which can break the stoutest of hearts. \\n\\n Spear guardians protect the flanks by pre-empting charges and bracing their qiang spears at an angle, so only the most foolish or brave cavalry dare charge them. \\n\\n This makes them a target for missile attacks, so they are outfitted in leather armour and carry large shields to protect themselves from the expected rain of arrows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_sabre_infantry_metal	The zhibeidao is a straight-bladed sword. Cheap and quick to master, it is a weapon ideal for equipping massed troops, particularly those with little training. \\n\\n Sabre Infantry are better trained than their militia counterparts, but their swords and purpose remain the same - to target less mobile enemies and engage with them in close combat, clearing the way for more specialist units.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_ji_infantry_wood	In ages past, the tribes of the south held together as one unified band, significant enough to be known as the state of Yue. With the advent of the Han, however, such places and titles are no longer fitting, as the Yue have fractured. \\n\\n The disparate remnants of the state are scattered across the vast southlands, clinging to their lineage. They refuse to relent, offering their strength to Zheng Jiang who will lead them to regain their freedom.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_di_marauders_earth	The nomadic lifestyle of the Di tribespeople has honed their skills in cavalry warfare, forging them into an unstoppable force. \\n\\n The power of their cavalry charges is almost unmatched, and once the initial impact of the charge has scattered their foes, they start hacking and chopping at those still standing with expertly made zhibeidao swords. \\n\\n These Qiang horsewomen are well defended with rattan shields and iron and leather armour, making them reasonably well protected in sustained close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_sabre_cavalry_earth	The advantage of sabre equipped cavalry lies in their mobility and versatility; partial iron armour and finely-woven rattan shields protect them from arrow attacks as they close the distance between enemy archers. \\n\\n Once they catch up, they quickly cut their foes down with straight-edged zhibeidao swords. These swords also prove effective against enemy cavalry, so Sabre Cavalry can race across the battlefield to intercept their equivalents and defend vulnerable allies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_vanguards_fire	These cavalry target not only the bodies of their enemies, but their morale as well. Couched low on their mounts, ji polearms locked tightly under their arms, they charge hard and fast into enemies with the aim of striking fear and forcing them to rout from the battlefield. \\n\\n Once a charge is completed, they can ride out of range of retaliation and prepare for their next assault. Their iron armour provides some protection in close combat, but they remain vulnerable in sustained encounters and to missile attack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_swordguards_metal	The jian is a straight, double-edged sword known as the 'Gentleman of Weapons', and considered to be one of the four major weapons alongside the gun, dao and qiang. It takes a year of training before one is considered competent enough to use it, and so only the most skilled women are equipped with it. \\n\\n The role of the Taiyang Sword Guard is to hold the line against enemy attacks, and their swordsmanship, leather armour and shields enable them to do this long after others have fallen to exhaustion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_militia_sabres_metal	Named after the White Wave Valley they hail from, these rebel women have long resisted the corrupt ruling classes by employing guerrilla tactics. This fighting style forgoes any niceties if it means beating the enemy. \\n\\n Years of fighting outnumbered have made them fleet of foot, meaning they can rush to support beleaguered allies or charge quickly into enemy lines to destabilise them. Once engaged, these women's skills with sword and shield enables them to hold their own in close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tao_penitents_wood	These martial arts women have mastered the use of the gun staff, known as the ‘Grandfather of Weapons’. \\n\\n Effortless action means to act with the flow of chi rather than trying to impose an action against it, demonstrated by the graceful and organic parries of the staff as it mirrors the movement of the body. \\n\\n Each action flows to the next, allowing them to swiftly switch between defence and attack and utilise the minimum amount of energy, so they that they never tire in battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_reclaimers_wood	Armies have always had scavengers as can be deduced from the appearance of these women; their armour pieces are mismatched, put together by collecting those left in the aftermath of battle. \\n\\n Their most important function is to search and collect loot, weapons and armour to put towards the Great Peace. They are armed with spears and shields to defend themselves, and are capable of holding the line when called upon to do so.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_militia_mounted_lancer_fire	The Guardians of Huaxu are women personally selected by the empress for their proven excellence and loyalty. It is their loyalty and commitment to the great cause that ensures they never tire in battle, even when leading furious charges from the frontlines. \\n\\n To display and complement their status as the head of an army to enemies and allies alike, they wear magnificent armour and wield gou lian dao polearms, both items commissioned exclusively by the empress!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_melee_cavalry_earth	Zheng Jiang challenges the corruption that poisons China and has made many women question old loyalties. \\n\\n These noblewomen have renounced their former patriarchs to seek justice and redemption. Their previous life of privilege has trained and equipped them well, and they ride into battle clad in ornate armour upon impressive mounts of the finest stock. \\n\\n With axes ready and raised shields, the impact of their charge is merely a way to break the enemy’s lines for deadly close combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_horse_archers_water	The iron armour of these women provide ample protection while they track prey before chasing it down on horseback if it tries to flee. \\n\\n When targetting game, the technique is much the same; single out a kill, aim and let the arrow fly, then run them to ground. \\n\\n However, these mounted women are not accustomed to their quarry fighting back, so if they are forced to fight the enemy in close sword combat, they will be at a disadvantage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_zhenren_defenders_wood	Qiyun Mountain is a harsh mistress, and those who live there learn much of survival. Descending from the mountain, these women have joined Zheng Jiang and follow her into battle no matter the cost and no matter the result. \\n\\n Those who follow her do so with an unwavering zeal – it was she who offered them a home and purpose, and encourages any and all to fight back against marching Han warlords, and to defend their homes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_militia_archers_water	These emissaries are eager to convert all who seek to deny the glory of the Tai. This utter certainty leads them to believe they are invulnerable, and there may be some truth to it. \\n\\n Beneath their robes and Taoist charms, they are protected only by faith, but trained to parry blows with maces, impossible to rout, and their charges shake the hardiest of enemies. However, their devotion can easily tip into frenzied fanaticism, sending them on an uncontrolled rampage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_wudou_archers_water	There is little protection against the devastating power of a cavalry charge - the surest defence is to prevent enemy cavalry from even getting close to its target. \\n\\n An unrelenting rain of arrows will slow even the bravest of horses and blunt the force of their charge, if not kill them outright. This requires archers equal of strength and accuracy; strength to draw the bow, and accuracy to loose with precision.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_archers_water	A siyah is the rigid part of a bow, designed to increase and preserve the draw earlier, sustain the thrust upon firing, and give the arrow a final snap as it leaves the bow. The arrows fired therefore have an increased velocity and energy, making them very effective at punching through armour. \\n\\n Like many archers, these Taiyang troops can be vulnerable if attacked in close combat, but they are better trained than most, and have zhibeidao swords should they need to defend themselves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_di_horse_archers_water	The Di are a nomadic people who spent much of their history in thrall to more powerful nomads, such as the Xiongnu. They raided imperial lands as the Han dynasty weakened, but were eventually curtailed by the cunning Cao Cao. \\n\\n Well-trained in the versatility and speed of cavalry strikes, these women are a tactical boon to any commander, who can use them to constantly harass enemies with arrow fire, without much fear of reply.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_di_raiders_fire	The Di are a nomadic people who spent much of their history in thrall to more powerful nomads, such as the Xiongnu. They raided imperial lands as the Han dynasty weakened, but were eventually curtailed by the cunning Cao Cao. \\n\\n Clad in leather armour and armed with ji polearms, these women are highly mobile, excelling at striking enemy flanks, impaling foes upon their spears or crushing them beneath their mounts hooves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_di_cataphracts_fire	The Di are a nomadic people hailing from north of China. They were nominally tributaries to the previous dynasty, yet remained unruly and insolent to the Han emperors, until Cao Cao eventually tamed their tempestuous tempers and deployed them in his own armies. \\n\\n Cataphracts, heavily-armoured horses known for their devastating charge, are even more fearsome when deployed by the Xiongnu, who live their lives in the saddle and understand cavalry warfare better than any others!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_tianshi_vanguards_fire	Only the very finest warriors are chosen for the honour of serving the emperess as frontline troops. Women of exceptional talent who also show skill with the deadly jian sword are recommended to the Emperess as Defenders of Nuwa. \\n\\n If they pass inspection, they are rewarded with uniquely-crafted jian swords and composite bows to fight on the frontline. Their arrows have small pots of flammable oil affixed to them; the fuses are lit, and the arrow loosed to rain down fire upon their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_trebuchet_water	When besieging an enemy settlement, the first and greatest obstacle to overcome are its defences. Trebuchets launch heavy projectiles over long distances to batter down walls and barriers. \\n\\n A heavy counterweight is raised to lower a beam, and the projectiles are loaded onto the beam’s sling. \\n\\n A switch drops the counterweight, launching the projectiles; the impact is devastating but inaccurate, so trebuchets are best used against immobile targets such as walls rather than moving enemy troops.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ironic_multiple_bolt_crossbow_water	At a glance, this siege weapon appears to be the simple crossbow, yet bigger than before – and far, far more powerful. Its ten-foot long bolts, when fired, are powerful enough to cleave through ranks of soldiers, and thus are devastating against enemy lines. \\n\\n Loading more than one bolt per crossbow requires a significant amount more effort and reduces the accuracy of the weapon. However, when firing indiscriminately into advancing enemy lines, accuracy is secondary – by an order of magnitude – to raw destructive power.	false
