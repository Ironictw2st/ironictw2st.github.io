effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_0	The time for peaceful compromise has long past. In order to fulfil your duties as a governor, you must eradicate those which threaten your domain, with force.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_1	A tiger cannot cower in his den whilst his territory is threatened by another. Your lands were appointed for you to legally govern, and you cannot allow greedy warlords to take them from you. If diplomacy fails, more drastic measures will be needed.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_2	You worry your neighbours think you a fool. Promises are being broken, and sworn deals are being discarded. Lest negotiations begin to break down, you must focus your administration towards defence. Recruit more soldiers, and consider replacing farming tools with spears and blades.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_3	Your administration is a flexible one, with bias being shown to neither the dove of peace nor the tiger of war. You are poised to adapt to any issue that may arise, be it internal or external. 	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_4	Although brigands and caitiffs continue to nip at your holdings, it is now time to de-escalate your military build up. Allow your soldiers to return to their fields for now, and concentrate your efforts on crop management and the flow of goods.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_5	Even heinous and wicked foes can see reason with clever logic and reasoned debate. By making steps towards peace, you are bettering the realm for everyone, not only those under your direct governance. Allow the men in your domain to be fathers and farmers, not warriors.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_governor_resource_level_6	Your dominion is prosperous and stable - and you will see it remain that way, not with your blade but with your words. Resources and food shall flow through your realm, and diplomacy shall keep your neighbours content.	true
