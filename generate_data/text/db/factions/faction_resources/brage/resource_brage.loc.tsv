effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_rage_resource_level_0	You curse your own men for their ineptitude. You flog them for their weakness, you execute them for their cowardice. The disorganised mob you call an army brings shame to the very name of your people.	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_rage_resource_level_1	The untrustworthy masses under your alleged control mock you with their incompetence. Your chieftains openly plot against each other and bicker over petty disputes, and your warriors care more about securing their gains than riding into battle. Can you risk your grasp on power slipping even further?	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_rage_resource_level_2	You need to bring a heightened sense of order and discipline to your hordes.

effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_rage_resource_level_5	With vim and vigor, your armies are truly relentless. Is there any force in the land capable of halting your momentum? 	true
effect_bundles_localised_description_ironic_rage_resource_level_6	Your military might decimates all that stand before you! Let rivals try and oppose you. You will crush them, like all the rest.	true
