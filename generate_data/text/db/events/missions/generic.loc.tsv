missions_localised_title_3k_main_tutorial_mission_han_faction_beats_han	Sensing Opportunity, a New Hero Rises	false
missions_localised_description_3k_main_tutorial_mission_han_faction_beats_han	"I bring grave news, my lord. Even after his  wicked razing of the old capital, the tyrant remains firmly in control of the Son of Heaven, having barricaded himself behind the walls of Changan. From there, his lackeys spread misery and woe to those loyal to the Han, and with the coalition fallen apart, it seems there will be no swift end to this chaos. With discord, however, comes opportunity, my lord. Dong Zhuo's own minions are attempting to challenge your authority over the county. They may claim to be following the commands of His Majesty, but pay no heed to this and give them no quarter. You must establish your own position, and begin developing your own strength. After all, it is said that a land divided is destined to be reunited...and perhaps, my lord, you possess the ambition and talent to do just that..."	false
missions_localised_title_3k_main_tutorial_mission_han_faction_beats_yt	In The Name of the Han, Raise Your Blade to Reestablish Order!	false
missions_localised_description_3k_main_tutorial_mission_han_faction_beats_yt	"My lord, I bring dire reports! Remnants of the traitorous Yellow Turban Rebels have been spotted throughout your lands, taking up arms against local villages and seizing crops from our beleaguered farmers. Should they be left unchecked for too long, the dying embers of their revolt may yet reignite into a fierce wildfire! These bandits and troublemakers are, thankfully, still a disorganized mob, and a swift and decisive show of force should be enough to scatter them. Prove to the world that you have no tolerance for rebellion, my lord, and crush these impudent criminals in the name of the Han! After that, consider your position, and be wary of those around you. Order must be restored to the land, whether by treaty, or by the blade..." 	false
missions_localised_title_3k_main_tutorial_mission_barbarian_faction_beats_han	Smelling Blood, A Warrior Takes His Chance	false
missions_localised_description_3k_main_tutorial_mission_barbarian_faction_beats_han	For many years, your people have been stifled under the boots of the Han. Your men have been forced to fight and spill their blood in their wars - wars often fought against your very kin. Storytellers regale days of glory, where the vast steppes were an ocean dominated by your ancestors, where all under the Heavens feared the name of your people. Blades grow dull and warriors grow old as those times of ascendency and glory seem so long ago. Vast kingdoms and confederacies have given way to shattered tribes and conquered domains, as you and yours are forced to live on the squalid frontiers of what the Han people call their "Empire." Every good hunter, however, knows the virtues of patience. News arrives from all over - the warlords of the Han are fighting amongst themselves! Their borders are undefended, their garrisons weak. This, this is your chance to renew the honour of your people, and remind these accursed men of the Han why your warriors were once so feared! Whilst they squabble amongst themselves, take this chance to crush whichever poor and depleted rabble has been left to watch your borders. Then, rally your warriors, restore old alliances, and prepare yourselves! The bounty of China is a prize only the mightiest can lay claim to...	false

missions_localised_description_3k_main_tutorial_mission_han_faction_takes_land	The people in the neighbouring regions have been suffering heavily under the poor and cruel rule of unfit prefects and administrators. You have heard reports that they cry out for a kind and just lord to liberate them from their oppressive fate. You cannot let this opportunity go to waste. Take advantage of an ill-prepared enemy by striking hard and fast. Only meagre garrisons, barely trained and poorly commanded, stand in the way of your forces. Command your generals to secure the region at once. After their inevitable victory, the grateful commoners and gentry alike will sing your praises for their liberation. In return for saving them, put the populace and their resources to good use to strengthen your position and bolster your alies.	false

missions_localised_description_3k_main_tutorial_mission_barbarian_faction_become_bandit	By climbing the ladder of the 'nobility' in your own way, you will prove to the decadent snobs of the Han nobility that you are every inch their equal and more. Start with the buffoon tyrant, Dong Zhuo, and show them all, that as your power grows, they must fall in line - or fall!	false

missions_localised_description_3k_main_tutorial_mission_bandit_faction_fights_han	"Boss, looks like the nobles and gentry are sending an army after you! Seems like they've gotten word of your recent "activities". Looking at them, though, I see nothin' to fear. They probably expect you to run and hide somewhere, so why not take advantage of their arrogance? Teach them a lesson not to underestimate you, by hitting them first! Trust me, once you tell the lads about how full the enemy supply train, they'll be raring to go!	false

A whole region protected only by beardless young boys and sick old men. Looks like they're underestimating you again! The loot from their coffers and grain from their silos will keep the lads happy for a while. Besides, we could do with a new hideout, somewhere we can secure and spread our influence from! Just give the word, boss, and we'll do the rest!"	false
