incidents_localised_description_ironic_liu_dai_confederate_by_cao_cao	Liu Dai, protector of the Yan Province, finds his territories hard pressed against ever increasing masses of Yellow Turbans who have migrated south from the Qing Province. Although his own desires involve rallying an army to storm the capital and rescue his relative the Emperor, he has been forced to turn his attention homewards to answer this rebellious threat. Against the advice of Bao Xin, the Chancellor of Jibei, Liu Dai gathers his forces and rushes the rebellious masses head on. \\n\\nTragically, this aggressive act is no match for the sheer number of enemy warriors, and Liu Dai perishes on the battlefield. His officers, including Bao Xin, recommend that the mantle of Yan Province's guardian is given to none other than Cao Cao, who gladly takes the province's remaining generals and soldiers into his own ranks. \\n\\nHis initial attempt to pacify the rebels ends poorly, however, with Bao Xin sacrificing his own life for the sake of his. Despite an initial setback, this is a huge step forwards for the cunning Cao Cao, who seeks an opportunity to absorb these rudderless rebels into his own army...	false

incidents_localised_description_ironic_kong_zhou_dies_yuan_shu_takes	Kong Zhou, the respected and famed Inspector of the Yu Province, falls to a sudden illness. As he was previously a leading member of the Coalition against the tyrant, and nominal ruler of a significant swathe of land, his abrupt demise causes an immediate power vacuum in the Central Plains. \\n\\nKong Zhou's former allies scramble to try and act upon this, but it is the wily Yuan Shu who moves first. Even as the land still mourns for the passing of the renowned scholar, his territory falls into the clutches of a subordinate of Yuan Shu. This show of blatant aggression and brazen ambition enrages Yuan Shao, who was already losing patience with the deeds of his half-brother. \\n\\nThe Coalition all but officially shatters, as each warlord looks to his own neighbour's territories, with both anticipation and greed.	false
incidents_localised_title_ironic_chen_wen_perishes	Yang Mourns a Governor's Demise, Yuan Shu Encroaches Ever Eastward	false
incidents_localised_description_ironic_chen_wen_perishes	News spreads quickly throughout the realm, reporting the very sudden death of Chen Wen, the dynamic Governor of the Yang Province. Although the reports suddenly he was overcome by an abrupt and harsh sickness, darker rumours are abound. Unproven whispers suggest that none other than the crafty Yuan Shu had a hand in Chen Wen's death. Regardless of the truth, it is undeniable that Yuan Shu is moving swiftly to take advantage of it. Pressed hard by Liu Biao in northern Jing and Cao Cao in Yu, Yuan Shu evacuates many of his armies and relocates them in Huainan. It appears that the infamous Yuan brother has new goals, and has set his sights upon the remainder of the Yang province to the south and the east...	false
