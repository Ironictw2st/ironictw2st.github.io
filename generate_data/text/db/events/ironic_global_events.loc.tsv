incidents_localised_description_ironic_event_yuan_shao_confederates_han_fu	The Governor of Ji, Han Fu, has found himself in a precarious position. As the Coalition falls apart around him, he considers himself trapped on a precipice, with strong and powerful rivals all around him, eager to take his bountiful land for themselves. Several of his advisors and friends, including Gao Gan, warn him of Gongsun Zan's ambitions and suggest an invasion is inevitable. Thanks to the counsel of these advisors that he considers friends, Han Fu is convinced that he alone cannot possibly stand against Gongsun Zan. Thus, with a touch of timidity and naivety,  he agrees to submit to Yuan Shao, trusting that their combined efforts are enough to safeguard the province.

incidents_localised_description_ironic_event_gongsun_zan_declare_war_on_liu_yu	Gongsun Zan was for many years a trusted general of Liu Yu, and together they acted as sword and brush alike when dealing with the frontier tribes. Over time, however, tensions have begun to rise between the two. Liu Yu, fearing that Gongsun Zan's ambitions may swell too much, raises troops and attempts to curb his growth. Gongsun Zan, meanwhile, uses politics to give himself a reason to rebel against his former master. Yuan Shao and others had put Liu Yu as a candidate to replace the Emperor, citing his virtues and royal blood. Even though Liu Yu had staunchly refused this, Gongsun Zan made an accusation of treason, and rallied his armies. Now, the White Horse General begins to rampage across Liu Yu's borders, and the initial skirmishes at least go his way. Can Liu Yu's benevolence and political acumen be enough to stop the might of his former officer, now enemy?	false

With none suspecting either their true loyalties nor your own hand in the plot, a final option presents itself. Although it would reveal you as the mastermind, you could have your operative now turn over their lands and assets over to you, giving you full dominance over what was once an independent faction.
